negative	a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
negative	contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .

negative	super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers .

negative	it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
negative	even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .

negative	this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash . 
negative	the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .

negative	remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
negative	unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller .

negative	a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
negative	might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
negative	nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
negative	despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
negative	despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
negative	de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
negative	verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
negative	this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
negative	[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
negative	there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
negative	the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
negative	as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
negative	the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
negative	sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
negative	this time kaufman's imagination has failed him . 
negative	frenetic but not really funny . 
negative	an awful snooze . 
negative	godawful boring slug of a movie . 
negative	accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
negative	a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
negative	one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
negative	 . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
negative	it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
negative	 . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
negative	all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
negative	mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
negative	considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
negative	doesn't amount to much of anything . 
negative	the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
negative	it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
negative	can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
negative	proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
negative	the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
negative	this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
negative	john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
negative	given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
negative	a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
negative	so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
negative	the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
negative	as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
negative	choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
negative	opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
negative	suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
negative	newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept – a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
negative	though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
negative	at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
negative	denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
negative	there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
negative	message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
negative	a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
negative	quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
negative	what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
negative	looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
negative	sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
negative	just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
negative	the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
negative	don't let your festive spirit go this far . 
negative	hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
negative	movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
negative	a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
negative	the movie gets muted and routine . 
negative	i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
negative	a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
negative	as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
negative	calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
negative	none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
negative	 . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
negative	the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
negative	blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
negative	shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
negative	only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
negative	the central story lacks punch . 
negative	sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
negative	the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
negative	it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
negative	all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . 
negative	the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
negative	the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
negative	there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
negative	the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
negative	martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
negative	what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
negative	a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
negative	it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
negative	going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
negative	i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
negative	[morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
negative	passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
negative	warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard . 
negative	there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
negative	why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 
negative	despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
negative	the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
negative	flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
negative	even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
negative	strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
negative	this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
negative	winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
negative	with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
negative	'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
negative	watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
negative	just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
negative	bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
negative	a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
negative	the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
negative	looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
negative	call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
negative	a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
negative	contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
negative	[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
negative	it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 
negative	originality is sorely lacking . 
negative	i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
negative	unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
negative	the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
negative	the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
negative	kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
negative	kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
negative	some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
negative	this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
negative	like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
negative	the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
negative	as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
negative	roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
negative	ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
negative	the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
negative	schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
negative	the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
negative	unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
negative	kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
negative	a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
negative	a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
negative	an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
negative	definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
negative	good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
negative	this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
negative	directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
negative	a timid , soggy near miss . 
negative	i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
negative	strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
negative	with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
negative	after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
negative	nothing about this movie works . 
negative	i can't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents . . . 
negative	perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
negative	the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
negative	reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
negative	never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
negative	to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
negative	it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
negative	while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often . 
negative	the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
negative	an extremely unpleasant film . 
negative	contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
negative	a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
negative	a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
negative	[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
negative	lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
negative	formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
negative	this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
negative	nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
negative	boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
negative	predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
negative	an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
negative	unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
negative	we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
negative	alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
negative	told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
negative	adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
negative	the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
negative	behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
negative	the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
negative	there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
negative	ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes . 
negative	unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression . 
negative	the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
negative	it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
negative	aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
negative	a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
negative	a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
negative	 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
negative	if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
negative	the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
negative	the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
negative	it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
negative	in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
negative	plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
negative	no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
negative	the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
negative	 . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
negative	episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 
negative	in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
negative	wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
negative	aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
negative	a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
negative	while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
negative	it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
negative	for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
negative	paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
negative	an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
negative	borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
negative	everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
negative	the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
negative	plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
negative	falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
negative	almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
negative	one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
negative	as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
negative	swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
negative	imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
negative	a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
negative	it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
negative	many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
negative	the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
negative	humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
negative	nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
negative	this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
negative	staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
negative	the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
negative	an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
negative	ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
negative	some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
negative	an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
negative	demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
negative	high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
negative	the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
negative	every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
negative	the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
negative	full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
negative	this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
negative	kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
negative	has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
negative	what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
negative	collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
negative	the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
negative	all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
negative	they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
negative	ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
negative	most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
negative	a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
negative	except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
negative	an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
negative	not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
negative	sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
negative	frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . 
negative	 " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
negative	it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
negative	what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
negative	strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
negative	like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . 
negative	a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
negative	while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
negative	if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
negative	a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
negative	those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
negative	the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
negative	tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
negative	makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
negative	even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
negative	it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
negative	the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
negative	[t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
negative	director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
negative	all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
negative	one thing's for sure—if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
negative	appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
negative	ill-considered , unholy hokum . 
negative	amazingly lame . 
negative	like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
negative	forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
negative	instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
negative	to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
negative	van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
negative	represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
negative	as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
negative	it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
negative	from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
negative	once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
negative	[a] slummer . 
negative	[allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
negative	a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
negative	the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
negative	this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
negative	the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
negative	it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
negative	it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
negative	i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
negative	its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
negative	most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
negative	the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
negative	it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
negative	falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
negative	an empty , purposeless exercise . 
negative	a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
negative	this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
negative	low rent from frame one . 
negative	 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
negative	this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
negative	'this movie sucks . '
negative	though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
negative	 " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
negative	a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
negative	predictably melodramatic . 
negative	too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
negative	although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
negative	the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
negative	while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
negative	forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
negative	when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
negative	burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
negative	simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
negative	lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
negative	death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
negative	the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
negative	it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
negative	behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
negative	the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
negative	festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
negative	plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
negative	blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
negative	it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
negative	this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
negative	the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
negative	the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
negative	everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
negative	the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
negative	yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
negative	even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
negative	it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
negative	rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world . 
negative	the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
negative	some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
negative	it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
negative	the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
negative	one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
negative	essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
negative	the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
negative	final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
negative	throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
negative	this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
negative	humor in i spy is so anemic . 
negative	skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
negative	in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
negative	queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
negative	a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
negative	too much power , not enough puff . 
negative	his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
negative	the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
negative	viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
negative	the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
negative	with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
negative	eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
negative	boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
negative	blue crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
negative	reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
negative	it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
negative	 if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
negative	a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
negative	offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
negative	nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant . 
negative	partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
negative	ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism . 
negative	[macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
negative	has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
negative	pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
negative	the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
negative	despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie
negative	a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy . 
negative	we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
negative	rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
negative	witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 
negative	kapur's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . 
negative	 " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store " 
negative	there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
negative	the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
negative	all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
negative	after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
negative	decent but dull . 
negative	only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
negative	the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
negative	by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
negative	a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
negative	i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
negative	takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
negative	viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 
negative	unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
negative	the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
negative	i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
negative	the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book . 
negative	the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
negative	how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
negative	quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
negative	the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
negative	a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
negative	twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
negative	the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
negative	bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
negative	a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
negative	my own minority report is that it stinks . 
negative	the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
negative	while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
negative	the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
negative	nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
negative	meanders between its powerful moments . 
negative	[t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
negative	one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 
negative	the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
negative	if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
negative	 . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
negative	producer john penotti surveyed high school students . . . and came back with the astonishing revelation that " they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them . " ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway
negative	sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?

positive	'pocas veces es posible ver un elenco tan compenetrado con la historia , donde todos y cada uno de los actores ofrecen actuaciones verdaderamente memorables . '
positive	the acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans . 
positive	both damning and damned compelling . 
positive	much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it . 
positive	making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
positive	the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .
