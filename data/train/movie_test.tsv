negative	the whole film has this sneaky feel to it as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
negative	there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .

negative	a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
negative	a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
negative	a puzzling experience . 
negative	tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple — he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better .

negative	a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
negative	a sometimes tedious film . 
negative	what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
negative	for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .

negative	it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
negative	not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
negative	the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
negative	the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult .

negative	there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
negative	i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
negative	this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
negative	a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
negative	the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither .

negative	an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
negative	laughably , irredeemably awful . 
negative	i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then .

negative	anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
negative	the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
negative	instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
negative	the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
negative	expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
negative	nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
negative	might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
negative	the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
negative	nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
negative	i hated every minute of it . 
negative	a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
negative	ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
negative	if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
negative	there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
negative	i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
negative	the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
negative	the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .

negative	the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
negative	[director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
negative	could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence .

negative	being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
negative	offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
negative	mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
negative	for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .

negative	enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
negative	a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
negative	well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
negative	it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
negative	you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
negative	but buying into sham truths and routine " indie " filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .

negative	except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
negative	who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '

negative	time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
negative	although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .

negative	strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
negative	both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
negative	this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
negative	the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
negative	it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
negative	kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
negative	after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .

negative	the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
negative	lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
negative	this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
negative	if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .

negative	maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
negative	the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
negative	its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
negative	the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
negative	a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
negative	it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work .

negative	fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
negative	interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
negative	schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
negative	to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
negative	pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
negative	it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 
negative	it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
negative	though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .

negative	they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
negative	potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
negative	 . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
negative	a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .

negative	starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
negative	we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .

negative	adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
negative	too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
negative	the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
negative	the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
negative	certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
negative	it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
negative	while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
negative	the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
negative	deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
negative	theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
negative	this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
negative	been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
negative	the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
negative	forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
negative	such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
negative	the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
negative	the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
negative	exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
negative	the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
negative	all mood and no movie . 
negative	press the delete key . 
negative	there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
negative	lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
negative	there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
negative	wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
negative	has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
negative	it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
negative	woody , what happened ? 
negative	juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
negative	the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
negative	rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
negative	this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
negative	there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
negative	ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
negative	the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
negative	even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
negative	more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
negative	bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
negative	when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
negative	marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue . 
negative	this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
negative	if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn . 
negative	silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
negative	definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
negative	the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
negative	don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
negative	like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
negative	the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
negative	not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
negative	those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
negative	the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
negative	spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
negative	a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
negative	an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
negative	has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
negative	everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
negative	a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
negative	talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 
negative	the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
negative	charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
negative	expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished . 
negative	a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
negative	little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
negative	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
negative	the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
negative	koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
negative	it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
negative	a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
negative	even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
negative	one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
negative	unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
negative	it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
negative	chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
negative	the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
negative	the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
negative	spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
negative	imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes . 
negative	i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
negative	essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
negative	 . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
negative	a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
negative	it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
negative	no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
negative	you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
negative	final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
negative	you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
negative	any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
negative	at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
negative	debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
negative	one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
negative	the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
negative	the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
negative	the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
negative	though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
negative	humor in i spy is so anemic . 
negative	in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
negative	the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
negative	manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
negative	the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
negative	queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
negative	the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
negative	possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
negative	feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
negative	director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
negative	it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
negative	as saccharine as it is disposable . 
negative	you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
negative	the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
negative	for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
negative	despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
negative	there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
negative	the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
negative	enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid . 
negative	the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
negative	you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
negative	forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
negative	if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
negative	a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
negative	 . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
negative	most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
negative	an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
negative	woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
negative	its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
negative	human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
negative	a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
negative	a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
negative	the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
negative	this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
negative	a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
negative	 . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
negative	the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
negative	too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 
negative	stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
negative	the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally . 
negative	 . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
negative	a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set . 
negative	almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability . 
negative	an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
negative	a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
negative	the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
negative	as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
negative	not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
negative	i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 
negative	 " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store " 
negative	there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture .

negative	i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
negative	all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
negative	those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
negative	the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms . sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine . 
negative	if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
negative	after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
negative	forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore . 
negative	lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
negative	the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
negative	no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
negative	a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
negative	the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
negative	several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
negative	i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
negative	too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
negative	it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
negative	a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
negative	takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
negative	the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects — from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
negative	i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
negative	the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor . 
negative	several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
negative	although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action . 
negative	supposedly , pokemon can't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over . 
negative	the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
negative	this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm…might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
negative	the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
negative	how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know .

negative	i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
negative	this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
negative	national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
negative	it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
negative	frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
negative	my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . . 
negative	too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
negative	with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
negative	reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . 
negative	the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
negative	if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
negative	 . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .

negative	the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . 
negative	well-meant but unoriginal .

negative	it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
negative	pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable . 
negative	about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
negative	reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
negative	one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 
negative	the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
negative	dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
negative	hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
negative	has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
negative	smothered by its own solemnity . 
negative	the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
negative	breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
negative	 . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
negative	a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
negative	not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
negative	a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
negative	the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
negative	for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
negative	producer john penotti surveyed high school students . . . and came back with the astonishing revelation that " they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them . " ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway

negative	naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
negative	hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 
negative	like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
negative	less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession . 
negative	it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
negative	sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
negative	the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
negative	draggin' about dragons
negative	the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
positive	the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
positive	like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame . 
positive	the movie's captivating details are all in the performances , from foreman's barking-mad taylor to thewlis's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany/mcdowell's hard-eyed gangster .

positive	it may be a no-brainer , but at least it's a funny no-brainer . 
positive	the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal . 
positive	art-house to the core , read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema .

positive	carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper . 
positive	 " home movie " is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book . 
positive	both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
positive	consistently clever and suspenseful . 
positive	the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill . 
positive	throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh . 
positive	scherfig's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky . 
positive	the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting . 
positive	this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors . 
positive	this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
positive	a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment . 
positive	the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
positive	there's a lot of tooth in roger dodger . but what's nice is that there's a casual intelligence that permeates the script . 
positive	you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade . 
positive	a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise . 
positive	the film truly does rescue [the funk brothers] from motown's shadows . it's about time . 
positive	works because we're never sure if ohlinger's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks . 
positive	skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults . 
positive	while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort . 
positive	a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . .
