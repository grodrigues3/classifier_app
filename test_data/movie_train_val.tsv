negative	the film is flat . 
negative	the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
negative	an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
negative	so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
negative	contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . 
negative	nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
negative	love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . 
negative	pompous and garbled . 
negative	if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
negative	other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
negative	since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
negative	the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
negative	bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
negative	it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the filmit was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending . 
negative	this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
negative	philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
negative	the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
negative	none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
negative	a processed comedy chop suey . 
negative	simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
negative	fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
negative	if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
negative	the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
negative	the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
negative	on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
negative	this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong's john woo . he's not good with people . 
negative	an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
negative	rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
negative	ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
negative	the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
negative	a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
negative	the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
negative	there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
negative	suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
negative	the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
negative	alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors .

negative	mediocre fable from burkina faso .

negative	fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
negative	it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
negative	the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
negative	less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
negative	slick piece of cross-promotion . 
negative	too much of the humor falls flat . 
negative	though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
negative	no way i can believe this load of junk . 
negative	it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
negative	a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
negative	[h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
negative	the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
negative	how do you spell cliché ? 
negative	too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
negative	putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
negative	in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
negative	they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
negative	director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
negative	in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
negative	it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
negative	for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
negative	this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
negative	visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
negative	slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
negative	for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
negative	it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
negative	has all the depth of a wading pool . 
negative	weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
negative	woefully pretentious . 
negative	puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
negative	a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
negative	a puzzling experience . 
negative	the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
negative	whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
negative	the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . 
negative	samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
negative	 . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
negative	another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
negative	shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
negative	not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
negative	nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
negative	the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
negative	imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
negative	it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
negative	van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
negative	for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
negative	the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
negative	when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
negative	uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
negative	if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
negative	credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
negative	anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
negative	when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
negative	a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
negative	every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
negative	the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
negative	not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
negative	shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
negative	it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
negative	for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
negative	a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
negative	[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
negative	a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
negative	gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
negative	not even the hanson brothers can save it
negative	there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
negative	the worst film of the year . 
negative	somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
negative	kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
negative	if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
negative	sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
negative	you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
negative	dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
negative	being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
negative	with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry . 
negative	bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
negative	a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
negative	every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
negative	a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
negative	the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
negative	schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
negative	when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
negative	too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
negative	there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
negative	this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
negative	considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
negative	the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
negative	at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
negative	sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
negative	the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
negative	we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
negative	opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . " 
negative	trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
negative	 . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
negative	all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
negative	it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
negative	it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
negative	this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
negative	a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
negative	an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
negative	too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
negative	when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . 
negative	an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
negative	while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
negative	it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
negative	lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
negative	thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
negative	the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
negative	although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 
negative	with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
negative	a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
negative	needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
negative	director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
negative	a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
negative	this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
negative	[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
negative	after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
negative	this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . 
negative	a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
negative	the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
negative	un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image . 
negative	yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
negative	 . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
negative	will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
negative	blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
negative	when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
negative	it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
negative	this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
negative	a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
negative	what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
negative	sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
negative	some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 
negative	has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
negative	the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
negative	as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
negative	everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
negative	as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
negative	it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
negative	here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
negative	a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
negative	the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
negative	the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
negative	take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
negative	woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
negative	showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant " if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny " syndrome . 
negative	the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
negative	parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
negative	suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
negative	without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos . 
negative	a mild , reluctant , thumbs down . 
negative	schindler's list it ain't . 
negative	with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
negative	the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
negative	with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
negative	a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
negative	disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
negative	limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 
negative	a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
negative	this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
negative	for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
negative	lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert . 
negative	there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
negative	'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . 
negative	cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
negative	even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
negative	it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
negative	with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés . 
negative	not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
negative	[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
negative	some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
negative	the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 
negative	lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
negative	the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
negative	despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
negative	authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
negative	control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
negative	cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace . 
negative	nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
negative	good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
negative	this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
negative	fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
negative	imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
negative	a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
negative	plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
negative	i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
negative	these characters become wearisome . 
negative	like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . 
negative	qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
negative	if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . 
negative	a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
negative	the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
negative	it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
negative	this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
negative	written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
negative	the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
negative	one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
negative	never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
negative	nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
negative	the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
negative	very stupid and annoying . 
negative	every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
negative	apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
negative	if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
negative	abysmally pathetic
negative	this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
negative	does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
negative	a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
negative	boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
negative	just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
negative	the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point . 
negative	at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
negative	a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
negative	bland but harmless . 
negative	kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
negative	it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
negative	bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
negative	what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
negative	the story has little wit and no surprises . 
negative	there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
negative	a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
negative	this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
negative	an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
negative	her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . 
negative	how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
negative	there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
negative	it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
negative	what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
negative	execrable . 
negative	viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
negative	the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
negative	lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
negative	unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
negative	nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
negative	it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
negative	i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
negative	by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
negative	a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
negative	no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
negative	they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 
negative	alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
negative	like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
negative	worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
negative	the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
negative	the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
negative	the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
negative	this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
negative	cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
negative	 . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
negative	 . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
negative	a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
negative	overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
negative	in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
negative	dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
negative	the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
negative	rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 
negative	what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
negative	can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
negative	too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
negative	a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
negative	snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
negative	it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
negative	the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
negative	a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
negative	an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
negative	mildly entertaining . 
negative	a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
negative	 . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
negative	it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
negative	all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
negative	everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
negative	disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
negative	potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
negative	plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
negative	yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
negative	it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
negative	crikey indeed . 
negative	a decidedly mixed bag . 
negative	ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
negative	absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
negative	a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
negative	sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
negative	fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
negative	as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
negative	while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
negative	tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
negative	if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
negative	davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
negative	unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
negative	hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
negative	real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
negative	becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
negative	family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
negative	the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
negative	do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
negative	represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
negative	the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
negative	like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 
negative	there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
negative	there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
negative	a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
negative	the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
negative	here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
negative	weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes . 
negative	a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
negative	 . . . really horrible drek . 
negative	it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
negative	ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
negative	it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
negative	replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
negative	flat , misguided comedy . 
negative	the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
negative	the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
negative	a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
negative	it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
negative	it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
negative	this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
negative	there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
negative	a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
negative	while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
negative	too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
negative	exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair .

negative	when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
negative	rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
negative	the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
negative	it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
negative	competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
negative	the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
negative	as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
negative	a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
negative	time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
negative	ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
negative	the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
negative	a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard . 
negative	[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
negative	it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
negative	chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
negative	the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
negative	in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
negative	some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
negative	no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
negative	a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
negative	if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
negative	its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
negative	it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
negative	as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
negative	the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
negative	the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
negative	if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
negative	the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
negative	reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
negative	kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . ) 
negative	the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
negative	we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold . 
negative	offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
negative	stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
negative	almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability . 
negative	the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
negative	there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
negative	serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time . 
negative	a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
negative	i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
negative	too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
negative	the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
negative	those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
negative	this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . 
negative	takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
negative	for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
negative	mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
negative	a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
negative	an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
negative	all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
negative	if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
negative	my own minority report is that it stinks . 
negative	the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
negative	while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
negative	shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
negative	nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
negative	a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
negative	reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
negative	all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
negative	breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
negative	at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
negative	for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
negative	like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
negative	you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
negative	the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
negative	formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
positive	a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
positive	my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more . 
positive	after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . 
positive	 . . . even if you've never heard of chaplin , you'll still be glued to the screen . 
positive	a bodice-ripper for intellectuals . 
positive	so original in its base concept that you cannot help but get caught up . 
positive	art-house to the core , read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema . 
positive	an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , 'spy kids 2' is a visual treat for all audiences . 
positive	far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise . 
positive	the acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans . 
positive	even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
positive	both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
positive	the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
positive	 . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
positive	the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
positive	one of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while . . . 
positive	williams absolutely nails sy's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness . 
positive	it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun . 
positive	an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind
positive	this is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that doesn't reveal even a hint of artifice . 
positive	symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
positive	exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere . 
positive	if you're in the right b-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you . 
positive	for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
positive	there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front . 
positive	as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good . 
positive	enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast . 
positive	affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
positive	saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion . 
positive	the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
positive	it's unlikely we'll see a better thriller this year . 
positive	pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . 
positive	this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
positive	while the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it's awfully entertaining to watch . 
positive	i'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up . i liked it just enough . 
positive	a melancholy , emotional film . 
positive	the movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in . 
positive	steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic . 
positive	the modern remake of dumas's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action . 
positive	fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
positive	satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time . 
positive	it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . 
positive	i had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was earnest . 
positive	great character interaction . 
positive	one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie . 
positive	you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again . 
positive	i'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes . 
positive	the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean . 
positive	spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but " spider-man " certainly delivers the goods . 
positive	a wry , affectionate delight . 
positive	one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature . 
positive	an almost unbearably morbid love story . 
positive	working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli . . . ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up . 
positive	insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
positive	pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel . 
positive	the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . 1 tolkien's middle-earth . 
positive	take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema . 
positive	what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness . 
positive	occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
positive	a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview . 
positive	newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg . 
positive	may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
positive	sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open . 
positive	a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort . 
positive	it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
positive	the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes . 
positive	doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
positive	if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 
positive	i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
positive	somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
positive	digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world . 
positive	ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here . 
positive	sweet home alabama " is what it is – a nice , harmless date film . . . 
positive	a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . 
positive	purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 
positive	as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 
positive	the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture . 
positive	nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 
positive	an intelligent fiction about learning through cultural clash . 
positive	will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them . 
positive	a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution . 
positive	hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 
positive	compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady . 
positive	an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . 
positive	as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled ( literally and figuratively ) by desire . . . [sex and lucía] makes for an arousing good time . 
positive	celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that's hard to beat . 
positive	though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance . 
positive	i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie-- for its historical significance alone . 
positive	this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format . 
positive	grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
positive	there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way . 
positive	[ " take care of my cat " ] is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban south korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals . 
positive	few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness . 
positive	not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 
positive	a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
positive	in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work . 
positive	it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . . 
positive	as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions . 
positive	it's not life-affirming — its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 
positive	a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last . 
positive	possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm . 
positive	this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help . 
positive	 " antwone fisher " is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . 
positive	as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 
positive	the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
positive	 . . . ambition is in short supply in the cinema , and egoyan tackles his themes and explores his characters' crises with seriousness and compassion . 
positive	a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place . 
positive	it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . 
positive	as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn
positive	troubling and powerful . 
positive	it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . 
positive	a work of astonishing delicacy and force . 
positive	just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat . 
positive	reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .

positive	an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams . 
positive	ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar . 
positive	[fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
positive	pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura . 
positive	i don't think i've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto's iron man . 
positive	de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli . 
positive	hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue . 
positive	thoughtful , provocative and entertaining . 
positive	grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte .

positive	this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year .

positive	terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . 
positive	the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v . s . naipaul's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour .

positive	if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances . 
positive	reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .

positive	the series' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls' amusing personalities . 
positive	disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself .
